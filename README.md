# Richard.file42 — GitHub Pages package

This is a GitHub Pages–ready static site for Cambodia Kiteboarding.
Place the files in a public GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (main branch / root).

## Files
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- assets/ (empty folders for images/icons)

## Deploy
1. Create a public repository on GitHub (e.g. richard-file42).
2. Upload the files to the repository root.
3. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → Branch: main → Root.
4. After a minute your site will be available at:
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

## Notes
- This build uses gradient placeholders for images (Option B).
- To replace placeholder gallery images: add image files to assets/images/gallery/ and update index.html to reference them.
- Hero video uses a YouTube iframe inside a modal (autoplay enabled upon opening).

Enjoy — if you want I can also:
- Customize the copy, change contact numbers, or hook form submissions to a Google Sheet.
- Swap placeholders for real images and optimize them.
